# Physics-GRE-Testgen
command line (python) LaTeX physics GRE test generator

I need to practice for my physics GRE. Unfortunately, there do not exist any platforms out there capable of creating randomly generated tests.

I do not know the extent to which this project will be completed; I will be focussing primarily on the subjects in which I want to practice.

However, I will create one or more issues for every practice problem I encounter in the wild, up to compliance with copyright. 

Initial wave of questions will be sourced from the (publicly available) ETS:

https://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/practice_book_physics.pdf

Further waves will be based on the excellent aggregation of resources:

Github issues may contain exact copies of questions, but in general, contributions to source code should be problem ***generators*** capable of producing random problems of similar flavor or topic.

I invite any and all who wish to participate. Maybe one day this will be a useful tool to someone besides myself.
