# Physics-GRE-Testgen
command line (python) LaTeX physics GRE test generator

I need to practice for my physics GRE. Unfortunately, there do not exist any platforms out there capable of creating randomly generated tests.

I do not know the extent to which this project will be completed; I will be focussing primarily on the subjects in which I want to practice.

However, I will create one or more issues for every practice problem I encounter in the wild, up to compliance with copyright. 

Here is an excellent aggregation of resources:
